### Code to fit measured line fluxes to a grid of photoionization models

The code aims to calculate the best-fitting ISM parameters for a given target based on its optical emission lines when compÎ©red to a grid of theoretical flux predictions.

The theoretical emission line grid should sample different values of metallicity $Z$, ionization parameter $\log(U)$, metal-to-dust ratio $\xi$, hydrogen density $\log(n_\text{H})$, and C/O fraction.

The code is optimized for the following emission line grid:
